If you've ever gone to a website and read its comments section, you'll have seen that it's just a vitriolic, idiotic wasteland.

Why subject yourself to that?

Shut Up hides comments by default.  And, you can show comments on a page with a click of a button.  It will remember where you turn on comments, and will show them the next time you visit that site.

That's it.  Simple and free.  Enjoy!
